# Kotlin_Basics
Small single script kotlin projects to gain an understanding of the basics of Kotlin
## Projects:
Tic-Tac-Toe: A script to replicate the famous game Tic-Tac-Toe within the console. This was the first entry to this repository
Connect-Four: A replication of the famous connect-four game within the console. This project was discontinued due to getting wrapped up in messy code. It has taught me a valuable lesson in making use of proper classes and functions to improve code readability.
Minesweeper: A replication of the famous minesweeper game in the console. I focused on trying to make code more readable with this project and by doing so I was able to complete it efficiently. I learnt how to make use of the flood fill algorithm to fill in empty spaces on the playing field. 
Sorting tool: A tool used for sorting numbers, words and lines. It can receive inputs from files and output the sorted data to a file. You can also make use of the console for sorting your data instead. It offers two sorting types. Sorting by count: Sorts from least used to most used and shows the percentages of them appearing. Sorting naturally: Sorts by smallest to largest.
