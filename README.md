# Kotlin_Basics
Small single script kotlin projects to gain an understanding of the basics of Kotlin
## Projects:
Tic-Tac-Toe: A script to replicate the famous game Tic-Tac-Toe within the console. This was the first entry to this repository

Connect-Four: A replication of the famous connect-four game within the console. This project was discontinued due to getting wrapped up in messy code. It has taught me a valuable lesson in making use of proper classes and functions to improve code readability.

Minesweeper: A replication of the famous minesweeper game in the console. I focused on trying to make code more readable with this project and by doing this I was able to complete it efficiently. I learnt how to make use of the flood fill algorithm to fill in empty spaces on the playing field. 

Sorting tool: A tool used for sorting numbers, words and lines. It can receive inputs from files and output the sorted data to a file. You can also make use of the console for sorting your data instead. It offers two sorting types. Sorting by count: Sorts from least used to most used and shows the percentages of them appearing. Sorting naturally: Sorts by smallest to largest. 

Search engine: A tool used for searching data from a file. It takes a text file, your queries and search type selection and then outputs the data to the console. It has been optimized with the usage of inverted indexing as opposed to standard linear search, so it can handle large inputs without affecting performance too heavily. It offers 3 search types. Search by ALL: Data must match all of your query to show up, case-insensitive. Search by ANY: If data matches any of your query, it will show up. Search by NONE: If data matches your query, it will not show up and instead will output everything else. 

Steganography: A tool that can take an image and hide a secret message within the image. The message is not viewable by the human eye so you need to use the program to get the message back. The message is encrypted using XOR and is decrypted the same way. To use the program, the user must set an input image, an output image, a message and a password. To get the message out of the image they must use the output image from earlier and the same password in order to decrypt the message. It's a very handy tool!

Parking lot: A script to manage an imaginary car park. The user can create a car park of nearly any positive size and park cars inside the car park, remove cars, search by register, search by colour and find registers of a certain colour. They can also view the status of the whole car park and reset the car park by redefining the size. This project does not have input validation as Hyperskill does not accept it for successful projects so therefore it is delicate for incorrect inputs
